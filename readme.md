# Hi! I'm Angelos Toumanidis and I program for a hobby.
Honestly, I guess I just do things that I find interesting on here.

### I know a little of...
 - A good amount of Java and C#
 - JavaScript and it's surrounding ecosystems like Node
 - A little of machine learning, still learning!

I prefer to write in JavaScript because it's the language I'm most familiar with,
and provides the fastest way to begin some abstract concept.

In my repositories you may find generated documentations regarding everything I've learned so far.
Most of them have been generated by chatGPT and I do not charge for them. I mostly use them for my
own entertainment purposes but for the sake of having them somewhere I have uploaded them on here.
