# Hi! I'm Angelos Toumanidis and I program for a hobby.
Honestly, I guess I just do things that I find interesting on here.

### I know a little of...
 - A good amount of Java and C#
 - JavaScript and it's surrounding ecosystems like Node
 - A little of machine learning, still learning!

I prefer to write in JavaScript because it's the language I'm most familiar with,
and provides the fastest way to begin some abstract concept.

You may find random projects here and there, feel free to search.
